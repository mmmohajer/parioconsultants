<p>Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) were initiatives which stemmed from business, originally aimed at preventing penalties under emerging liability laws but rapidly became a reflection of business-government partnership. Today, it is an indication of business good citizenship. But the benefits of acquiring ISO certification go beyond the satisfaction of doing a good deed. Adhering to the standard not only result in better conformance to environmental regulations, but also greater marketability, better use of resources, higher quality goods and services, increased levels of safety, improved image and increased profits. The schemes are voluntary with third party certification process.

At PARIO we have the expertise and experience to plan and implement EMS for organizations of all sizes and sectors.
